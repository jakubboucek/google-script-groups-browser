# Google Script - Groups Browser
Browser of Google Groups in G Suite for domain's users

This tool allows your user to simple browse company's groups. Because Google doesn't provide any simple list of your Groups in domain you can use this tool to allow your users simple look to Groups and their members.

It's inspired by [Romain Vialard](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RomainVialard-public/posts)'s [Groups Directory](https://sites.google.com/site/scriptsexamples/available-web-apps/list-members-of-a-group) (origin source code of Script is no more available).
